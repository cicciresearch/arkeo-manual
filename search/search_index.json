When measuring rectangular devices, especially when the short side \\(b\\) is less than 10 times \\(s\\), shape effects start to be significant. These effects are corrected by the \\(F_3\\) term. Because there are other effects than just the straight edges, no analytical solution exists for rectangular shapes. Instead, the table above should be consulted. For devices that do not have the exact dimensions displayed in the table, interpolation should be used to extract the proper correction factor.</p>"},{"location":"routines/resistivity/scientific/#circular-substrate","title":"Circular Substrate","text":"<p>In contrast to rectangular devices, circular devices are much more symmetrical and analytical solutions exist. Smits \\cite{smits_measurement_1958} calculated the correction factor for circular samples when measured at the center (off-center measurements require additional corrections) as:</p> \\[ F_3\\left(\\frac{d}{s}\\right) = \\pi \\left[\\ln\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{(d/s)^2+3}{(d/s)^2-3}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\]"}]}
