The Arkeo stage allows for various accessories to be placed under or over the stage, depending on the test to be performed. The accessories snap to stage magnetically and are centered automatically as they fit perfectly in the aperture.

The following accessories are available:

=== "High-Speed LED"

    <div class="accessory-layout" markdown>
    <div class="accessory-text" markdown>

    **Description**

    This LED can be used to excite device at high-speed. Its response is in the ns regime and is ideal for fast transient tests like Transient Photovoltage and Photo-CELIV.

    **Performance**

    - 1MHz+ pulse modulation
    - 0.001- 2 SUN output power

    **Compatible Routines**

    - JV
    - MPPT
    - Impedance

=== "Spectrometer"

    <div class="accessory-layout" markdown>
    <div class="accessory-text" markdown>

    **Description**

    The spectrometer module contains a lens attached to a fibre to carry the signal to system-integrated spectrometer.

    **Performance**

    The performance depends on the specific spectrometer used

    **Compatible Routines**

    - Dark JV
    - Photoluminescence
    - Electroluminescence
    - Pulsed Electroluminescence

=== "Photodiode"

    <div class="accessory-layout" markdown>
    <div class="accessory-text" markdown>

    **Description**

    The photodiode can be used as a photodetector to capture electroluminescence signals as a cheaper alternative to a full spectrometer

    **Performance**

    - 300-1100 nm responsivity

    **Compatible Routines**

    - Dark JV

=== "Monochromatic line"

    <div class="accessory-layout" markdown>
    <div class="accessory-text" markdown>

    **Description**

    The monochromatic line module can be used to carry the monochromatic light from a monochromator to the stage. This allows for more flexibility in the installation of the setup as the monochromator line if often very large.

    **Performance**

    
    **Compatible Routines**
